If you hover the mouse over each field a tooltip will be displayed indicating the expected input.

These are

  This should be selected if this account should be included in your retirement planning finances.
  Typically this would be checked initially but can be unchecked if the account is no longer used
  or contains money that you don't wish to be included in funding your retirement.
