# Windows installer {#windows_installer}
The windows installers are now stored as github release files rather than in the repo due to their size.

They can be found at https://github.com/pjaos/retirement_finances/releases


## Install

Installing the retirement finances package onto a Windows PC no longer requires that Python is installed.

- Download the Retirement_Finances_5.0.exe file (version number  in the filename may change) from the above link.

- Double click on the downloaded file and step through the installation wizard.

When complete the Retirement_Finances launcher can be found from the Windows Start button.


## Uninstall

Use the Windows Add or Remove programs option to remove the retirement finances program.
